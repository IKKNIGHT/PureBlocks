# PureBlocks: Math-Centric Block Programming

PureBlocks is a browser-based block programming environment designed specifically for mathematical exploration and learning. It combines the ease of drag-and-drop blocks with the power of Python-like syntax for math operations.

## Key Features

- **Static HTML/CSS/JS**: Runs entirely in the browser with no backend required
- **Block-Based Python Syntax**: Drag-and-drop interface that generates clean Python-like code
- **Math-Centric Features**: Pre-built blocks for equations, plots, and algorithms
- **Trinket-Like Simplicity**: Clean UI with immediate execution

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Drag blocks from the left toolbox into the workspace
3. Click "Run" to execute your code
4. View the output in the right panel

## Math-Specific Blocks

- **Solve Equation**: Solves mathematical equations (e.g., `xÂ² + 3x = 0`)
- **Plot**: Creates visualizations of functions (e.g., `y = sin(x)`)
- **Is Prime**: Checks if a number is prime

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+Enter`: Run code
- `Ctrl+S`: Export as HTML

## Examples

Two example programs are included:
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Demonstrates number sequences and computation
- **Pythagorean Theorem Visualizer**: Shows geometric relationships

## Design Philosophy

PureBlocks aims to make mathematical concepts accessible through visual programming, with a clean interface inspired by tools like Trinket, Blockly, Desmos, and Wolfram Alpha.

## Limitations

- This is a prototype with simplified equation solving capabilities
- The Python interpreter is simulated in JavaScript and doesn't support all Python features
- Complex mathematical operations would require additional libraries in a full implementation

## Browser Compatibility

Tested on modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.
